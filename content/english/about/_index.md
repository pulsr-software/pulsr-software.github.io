The Pulsars have been discovered by Jocelyn Bell in 1967, and studied ever since with hughe-size radiotelescopes by the scientic community.
They are neutron stars, with ultra-fast spinning, and the rotation speed can be very precise, thus leading to a new category of oscillators, stables overy hundreds of thousands of years.
Pulsar is an abreviation of PULsating Radio Source : theses celestial bodies emits a powerfull radio-electromagnetic beam that behaves like a beacon in the sky, when crossing the observer path.
However theses signal are very small due to the observed distances, and diffucults to observe.
Today, they are used for measurements of low-frequency gravitationnal waves, in what is called a Pulsar Timing Array (PTA).

At **PulSR** our mission is to build an **industrial, flat and compact-size phased-array radiotelescope**  capable of recieving and processing pulsar's signals, in order to bring to the industry a new and **alternative source to improve the resiliency of PNT systems**.

Our technology is based on iterations on an innovative L-Band aperture array radiotelescope, adapted to pulsar observations (White paper under request).

We are based in Lyon (France), PulSR was funded in 2022 by an experienced team : an Astrophysicist (Julien L. - CSO), and R&D Engineer (Alexis R. - CEO & CTO) and a Business Developer (Nicolas G. - CFO). We are at pre-seed stage and currently developping the prototype.
